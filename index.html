            >
            Developed a basic version of the main report using Zoho Site Builder
            to serve as a prototype and future reference for similar projects.
            This involved researching and analyzing various existing
            Zoho-powered websites to extract layout ideas, structural patterns,
            and content presentation techniques. The following are a few of the
            reference links used in this process:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://www.zoho.com/sites/"

                  >https://www.zoho.com/sites/templates/</a
